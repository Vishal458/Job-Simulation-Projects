Task 2: Development - Prepare a software development proposal

Task overview - 
What you'll learn - How to turn a client's desires for a project into a proposal?
What you'll do - Write a proposal for creating a dashboard? 

--------------------------------------------------------
Here is the background information on your task -

Analysing offline data is great, but having a real-time overview of processes and smart alerts when things break is even better. Our client would like us to build a real-time manufacturing status dashboard. The first task of this process is drafting a development proposal. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is your task - 

Write a short, formal and informative development proposal for the following project:

 Private dashboard showing the health status of the 9 machines in each of Daikibo's 4 factories for which they collect telemetry.
 Access to the page happens only within the client's intranet.
 Authentication is synced to an internal authentication server (users can leverage their company-wide accounts).
 The dashboard consists of a single page listing the current status of all monitored devices.
 The view is collapsible/expandable at the factory and device levels (showing a history of statuses). 

What to include (please take a look at the document template): 

Overview
 An intro to the proposal and a high-level description of the project
Scope
 Describe the functionality of the project
 Reference the graphics included in the template
Estimate
 A total man-hour estimate + breakdown for development, testing, and integration
Timeline
 List the milestones of the project
Support
 Let the client know they can rely on continuous product support (e.g. bug fixes, support tickets, new functionality)
 
For this task, you will need some word-processing software. MS Office works if you have that, but you can also use free software like Libre Office (find a link in the Resources). Please find a template for your proposal document in the Resources. It is a good idea to keep the document as long as it is in the template (in terms of the number of pages).
