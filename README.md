# Job-Simulation-Projects

A job simulation program is a type of assessment that allows candidates to demonstrate their skills and abilities in a realistic work environment by performing tasks similar to those they would encounter on the job. A job simulation is a virtual or real-world experience where learners complete tasks similar to what they would do in an actual job. job simulations provide a hands-on, practical experience that mirrors the actual job requirements.
